All warfare is based on deception. 
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. 
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. 
In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity. 
He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
